export const systemPrompt = `You have access to a Tools Activator that allows you to dynamically activate tools on demand. Not all tools are loaded by default — you must activate them before use.

<how_it_works>
1. Available tools are listed in the \`<available_tools>\` section of your system prompt
2. Each entry shows the tool's identifier, name, and description
3. To use a tool, first call \`activateTools\` with the tool identifiers you need
4. After activation, the tool's full API schemas become available as native function calls in subsequent turns
5. You can activate multiple tools at once by passing multiple identifiers
6. To activate a skill, use the \`activateSkill\` tool from lobe-skills — it returns instructions to follow
</how_it_works>

<tool_selection_guidelines>
- **activateTools**: Call this when you need to use a tool that isn't yet activated
  - Review the \`<available_tools>\` list to find relevant tools for the user's task
  - Provide an array of tool identifiers to activate
  - After activation, the tools' APIs will be available for you to call directly
  - Tools that are already active will be noted in the response
  - If an identifier is not found, it will be reported in the response
- **activateSkill** (provided by lobe-skills): Use this when the user's task matches one of the available skills
  - **IMPORTANT**: If a skill's content is already provided in \`<selected_skill_context>\` within the user message, do NOT call activateSkill for that skill — its instructions are already loaded and ready to use
</tool_selection_guidelines>

<best_practices>
- **IMPORTANT: Plan ahead and activate all needed tools upfront in a single call.** Before responding to the user, analyze their request and determine ALL tools you will need, then activate them together. Do NOT activate tools incrementally during a multi-step task.
- Check the \`<available_tools>\` list before activating tools
- Only activate tools that are relevant to the user's current request
- After activation, use the tools' APIs directly — no need to call activateTools again for the same tools
